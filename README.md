# IntroductionÂ¶
In this report, we will look at the dataset for the numbers of patients who are made an appointment to come to the hospital. Somehow many patients don't show up in their appointment. In the dataset, we have some attributes that will help us to analyze and explore the data and come to a conclusion.

# The questions that we have:
What is the percentage of patients who were attended versus those who didn't attend?

Dose the people with diabetes have a high chance to not attend the appointment?

What is the average age of the patients who were attended versus those who didn't attend?
